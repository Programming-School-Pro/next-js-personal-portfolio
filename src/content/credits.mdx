I have been _greatly_ influenced by a bunch of beautiful people while working on this website. I'm not a very creative person myself, so a lot of things that you see here are a direct/indirect result of their work and efforts â€” show them some love!

## Inspiration

- [Josh W Comeau](https://joshwcomeau.com) has been, by far, the biggest inspiration for this website. 
- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com): Their [Flex](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) and [Grid cheatsheets](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) are top notch and I keep referring to them every now and then. 
- [Maximillian Laumeister](https://maxlaumeister.com) was the inpiration[^1] behind [/foobar](/foobar).
- [Max Stoiber](https://mxstbr.com) for a bunch of things including the layout of this website.
