## Hello there!

My name is Sreetam Das and I'm a Frontend Engineer at [Remote](https://remote.com).

I'm a self-taught developer with a degree in Metallurgy and Materials from [NIT Warangal](https://www.nitw.ac.in) _(psst, my alma matter's was the first big website I've worked on!)_. I've been fascinated by computers and the internet from around 8th grade when I used Google for the first time.
In the past, I've worked extensively with Python and the Google Cloud Platform, and been responsible for python _and_ UI rewrites of a flagship, future-ready product at my company. I work with a stack of React, Redux, and TypeScript. I am also a firm believer in developer tooling, and a couple of packages I install for just about every project can be found [here](https://github.com/sreetamdas/stack)

Outside of the world of programming, I am also a quizzer and was the lead at my college's [Quiz Club](https://www.facebook.com/qcnitw). Having played a lot of [CS](https://blog.counter-strike.net) in my childhood and college, I also love following the [CS:GO esports scene](https://www.hltv.org). I enjoy using mechanical keyboards and lurk [r/mk](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards) pretty much daily. I enjoy just about all genres of music and podcasts and am always looking for more ways to consume information from around the world.

You can check me out on the following platforms:
