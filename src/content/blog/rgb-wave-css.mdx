I recently created a [new page on this website](/fancy-pants). From an early time in my frontend journey, I have been amazed by the websites that are featured on [awwwards](https://www.awwwards.com/awwwards/collections/freelance-portfolio/) and I wanted to create something <Highlight><Sparkles>fancy</Sparkles></Highlight> like them.

Here's how I did it.
