Here's a couple of things that I include in my go-to stack:

- [Commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint): helps
  you and your team adhere to a commit convention, by checking checks if your
  commit messages meet the
  [conventional commit format](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0)

- [Prettier](https://prettier.io): only thing better than looking at beautiful
  code is not having to worry about formatting it

- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org): can&apos;t believe I put off working on NextJS
  for so long; it is an absolute delight!

- [Styled components](https://styled-components.com): CSS-in-JS _just works_

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org): type-safe code means that
  refactoring and catching bugs at code-write time itself becomes the norm

- [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org): an opinionated toolset for
  much more efficient redux development

<!-- need to add:
    - lint-staged + husky
    - eslint
    -
 -->

and here's a couple of packages that I've been keeping an eye out for:

- [Rome](https://romefrontend.dev): an approach to "Standardizing the web development experience" by consolidating a linter, compiler, bundler, and more for JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, Markdown, and CSS.

- [Snowpack](https://snowpack.dev): modern, lightweight bundler for web application development with [unbundled development](https://www.snowpack.dev/#unbundled-development)

- [ParcelJS](https://parceljs.org): a blazing fast app bundler which focuses on requiring minimal config
