## Hello there!

My name is Sreetam Das and I'm a Assoc. Tech Arch - SW Dev at [Microland](https://www.microland.com), currently working as the module lead for the Frontend Team.

I'm a self taught developer with a degree in Metallurgy and Materials from [NIT Warangal](https://www.nitw.ac.in) _(psst, my alma matter's was the first big website I've worked on!)_. I've been fascinated by computers and the internet from around 8th grade when I used Google for the first time.
More recently, I've worked extensively with Python and the Google Cloud Platform, and been responsible for rewrites of a flagship, future-ready products at my company. For frontend I work with a stack of React, Redux and TypeScript. I am also a firm believer in developer tooling, and a couple of packages I install for just about every project are: ESlint,

Outside of the world of programming, I am also a quizzer and was the lead at my college's [Quiz Club](https://www.facebook.com/qcnitw). Having played a lot of [CS](https://blog.counter-strike.net) in my childhood and college, I also love following the [CS:GO esports scene](https://www.hltv.org). I really enjoy using mechanical keyboards and lurk [r/mk](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards) pretty much daily. I enjoy just about all genres of music and podcasts, and am always looking for more ways to consume information from around the world.
