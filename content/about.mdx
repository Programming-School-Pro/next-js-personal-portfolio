## Hello there!

My name is Sreetam Das and I'm a Assoc. Tech Arch - SW Dev at [Microland](), currently working as the module lead for the Frontend Team.

I'm a self taught developer with a degree in Metallurgy and Materials from [NIT Warangal](https://www.nitw.ac.in). I've been fascinated by computers and the internet from around 8th grade when I used Google for the first time.
More recently, I've worked extensively with Python and the Google Cloud Platform, and been responsible for rewrites of a flagship, future-ready products at my company. For frontend I work with a stack of React, Redux and TypeScript.

Outside of the world of programming, I am also a quizzer and was the lead at my college's [Quiz Club](https://www.facebook.com/qcnitw). I enjoy just about all genres of music and podcasts, and am always looking for more ways to consume information from around the world.
