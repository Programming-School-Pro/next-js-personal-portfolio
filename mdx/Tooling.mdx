import { ExternalLink } from "components/Layouts";

Here's a couple of things that excite me:

-   [commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint): helps
    you and your team to adhere to a commit convention, by checking checks if your
    commit messages meet the
    [conventional commit format](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0)

-   [prettier](https://prettier.io): only thing better than looking at beautiful
    code is not having to worry about formatting it

-   [NextJS](https://nextjs.org): can&apos;t believe I put off working on NextJS
    for so long; it is an absolute delight!

-   [Styled components](https://styled-components.com): CSS-in-JS _just works_

-   [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org): type-safe code means that
    refactoring and catching bugs at code-write time itself becomes the norm

-   [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org): an opinionated toolset for
    much more efficient redux development
